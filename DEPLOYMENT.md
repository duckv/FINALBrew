## 🎯 Performance Tips

### For Better Loading

1. **Add real images**: Replace placeholder SVGs with actual photos
2. **Optimize images**: Use WebP format for modern browsers
3. **Add lazy loading**: For images below the fold
4. **Minify files**: Compress CSS and JS for production

### For SEO

1. **Update meta tags** in `index.html`
2. **Add structured data** for local business
3. **Create sitemap.xml**
4. **Add Google Analytics** tracking code

## 🔍 Testing

### Local Testing

Open `index.html` directly in browser, or use a local server:

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Python 2
python -SimpleHTTPServer 8000

# Node.js
npx http-server
```
